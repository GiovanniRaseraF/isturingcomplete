# [ X ] Is Turing Complete

This is an example of how to write a post showing that **[ X ] is Turing Complete** (ITC).

## Introduction

Use this section to introduce **[ X ]** — what it is, and why you believe it's interesting or important to show that it is Turing Complete.

Feel free to include any necessary **notations**, **abbreviations**, or **assumptions** to simplify your argument or make your explanation clearer.

## Demonstration

In this section, provide a demonstration — formal or informal — that shows how **[ X ] is Turing Complete**.

You might say something like:

- "I can create *if statements* using this technique..."
- "Sequences are possible if I use that..."
- "Loops can be created by combining these elements..."

You're welcome to go deep and write a detailed proof, but remember — this is meant to be a fun project, not a textbook on computation theory.

## Example

Here you can add concrete examples to support your demonstration.

If you're showing that a **video game** is Turing Complete, you could:

- Include a **YouTube video** showing your build in action
- Provide **step-by-step instructions** on how to recreate your setup
- Share **save files** so others can load and explore your project

## Credits

Please remember to **credit other creators** or sources you drew inspiration from. This is important — we build on the work of others, and acknowledging them strengthens the community.
